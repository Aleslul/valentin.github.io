        <p class="lirics">Nice to meet you, where you been? <br>
            I could show you incredible things <br>
            Magic, madness, heaven, sin <br>
            Saw you there and I thought <br>
            "Oh, my God, look at that face <br>
            You look like my next mistake <br>
            Love's a game, wanna play?" Ay <br> <br>



            New money, suit and tie <br>
            I can read you like a magazine <br>
            Ain't it funny? Rumors fly <br>
            And I know you heard about me <br>
            So hey, let's be friends <br>
            I'm dying to see how this one ends <br>
            Grab your passport and my hand <br>
            I can make the bad guys good for a weekend <br> <br>


            So it's gonna be forever <br>
            Or it's gonna go down in flames <br>
            You can tell me when it's over, mm <br>
            If the high was worth the pain <br>
            Got a long list of ex-lovers<br>
            They'll tell you I'm insane<br>
            'Cause you know I love the players<br>
            And you love the game<br> <br>


            'Cause we're young, and we're reckless<br>
            We'll take this way too far<br>
            It'll leave you breathless, mm<br>
            Or with a nasty scar<br>
            Got a long list of ex-lovers<br>
            They'll tell you I'm insane<br>
            But I've got a blank space, baby<br>
            And I'll write your name<br> <br>

            Cherry lips, crystal skies<br>
            I could show you incredible things<br>
            Stolen kisses, pretty lies<br>
            You're the King, baby, I'm your Queen<br>
            Find out what you want<br>
            Be that girl for a month<br>
            Wait, the worst is yet to come, oh, no<br> <br>



            Screaming, crying, perfect storms<br>
            I can make all the tables turn<br>
            Rose garden filled with thorns<br>
            Keep you second guessing like<br>
            "Oh, my God, who is she?"<br>
            I get drunk on jealousy<br>
            But you'll come back each time you leave<br>
            'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream<br> <br>

            So it's gonna be forever<br>
            Or it's gonna go down in flames<br>
            You can tell me when it's over, mm<br>
            If the high was worth the pain<br>

            But I've got a blank space, baby<br>
            And I'll write your name<br> <br>
            
            Boys only want love if it's torture<br>
            Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya<br>
            Boys only want love if it's torture<br>
